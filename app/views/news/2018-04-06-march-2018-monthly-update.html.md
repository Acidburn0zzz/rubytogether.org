Hello! Welcome to the monthly update. During March, our work was supported by [Coinbase](https://coinbase.com), [Cloud City Development](http://www.cloudcity.io), [DigitalOcean](http://www.digitalocean.com) and many others.

This month we were able to pay for 147 hours of developer work on Ruby open source. Thank you to all of the companies and individual developers that continue to support our work.

## bundler news

## ruby toolbox news

Hey everyone!

Last month, my main focus was converting the GitHub stats by syncing to their [GraphQL API](https://developer.github.com/v4/), which enabled the addition of a whole bunch of new project metrics while keeping the API rate limit consumption the same. I [launched them](https://twitter.com/TheDeadSerious/status/979097768177422337) at the end of March and you can see an example [here](https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/projects/hanami)â€”for instance, you can now see issue and pull request closure rates and recent commit activity.

Since I bumped into some minor issues that needed extra work while converting to the new API, I didn't get much time to spend on the other topic I mentioned in the last update: esier understandability on what the project metrics mean in the greater context of the Ruby ecosystem. Broadly speaking, I'd like to make some clear visual indicators in what range any given metric stands in relation to the Ruby ecosystem to make it easier to "grok" at a glance the healthiness of a project. For example, for gem downloads you could see that a given project is in the 10% most-often-downloaded gems, but for example issue closure rate, release activity and many more can become much more interesting when given this kind of context.

This will be my main focus in April, and I hope to have something to show to you in this regard next month. :)

As always, your feedback is very welcome. If you have any suggestions or thoughts you'd like to share you can do so via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox/issues) or by getting in touch with me directly.

Thank you also to everyone who contributed pull requests in March: BurdetteLamar, apa512, boazsegev, cvoltz, franklinyu, funk-yourself, konung, nesaulov, pmackay, and skatkov.

Best,<br>
Christoph
