<% title "November 2016 Monthly Update" %>

Welcome to the November 2016 Ruby Together monthly update! This month included maintenance work, security patches, helping users with problems, and @segiddins's heroic (but ultimately doomed) efforts to make Bundler respect `required_ruby_verison`. AndrÃ© travelled to Cincinnati, OH to give a talk about contributing to open source, and we paid for 129.5 hours of work on Bundler, RubyGems, and RubyGems.org.

We'll also be using this update to highlight our international contributors! They're mentioned in each relevant news section.

## ruby together news

On November 13, AndrÃ© gave a talk at [RubyConf](http://rubyconf.org) called [From No OSS Experience to the Core Team in 15 Minutes per Day](http://confreaks.tv/videos/rubyconf2016-from-no-oss-experience-to-the-core-team-in-15-minutes-a-day). It discusses the benefits and costs of doing open source work and provides a straightforward list of activities that can be done by anyone, no matter their level of experience with programming. Watch [the video](http://confreaks.tv/videos/rubyconf2016-from-no-oss-experience-to-the-core-team-in-15-minutes-a-day), check out [the slides](http://speakerdeck.com/indirect/from-no-oss-experience-to-the-core-team-in-15-minutes-a-day), and/or read the talk as a blog post: [How to Contribute to OSS](http://andre.arko.net/2016/11/12/how-to-contribute-to-open-source/).

At RubyConf, we gave away almost 1,000 stickers! We also gave almost 50 [Ruby Together lapel pins](https://twitter.com/rubytogether/status/795694158472048640) to members. If you're wishing for some stickers or lapel pins of your own, you're in luck! At RubyConf, we also launched [the Ruby Together shop](https://shop.rubytogether.org)!

Last in Ruby Together news, this month we partnered with [@mrb_bk](https://twitter.com/mrb_bk)'s [Computer Modern](http://computermodern.io). We need more companies to join as members for Ruby Together to be sustainable in the long run, so it's exciting to have expert help. We'll be working with Computer Modern in the coming weeks and months to create resources for Ruby developers and Ruby Together members. 

We had two improvements with our meta tooling this month. how-is got another [release](https://github.com/how-is/how_is/blob/v11.0.0/CHANGELOG.md#1100), and will soon be used to actively [appraise the status](https://how-is.github.io/how-is-rubygems/2016/12/01/report.html) of our various large projects. We also created a [time-card](https://github.com/rubytogether/rubytogether-lita/blob/84f6bec5d2faabbcb914132cd2880b8e7bacf33e/lib/lita/handlers/time_card.rb) handler for the [lita](https://www.lita.io/) bot, soon to be available for use in a chat room near you!
