## bundler news

This month [we released](https://github.com/bundler/bundler/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) Bundler 1.12.1 - 1.12.4. These changes were mainly bugfixes for the index format, but also notable was a series of small issues primarily effecting users running Bundler on continuous integration servers. We also worked on upcoming releases this month, specifically the 2.0 'Breaking Changes' and the 1.X 'Plugin System' releases. On the [Bundler-api](https://github.com/bundler/bundler-api) side, we setup a follower database to avoid downtime on the index service when AWS takes the primary database down for maintence later this month.

In total, [Bundler](https://github.com/bundler/bundler) and [Bundler-api](https://github.com/bundler/bundler-api) had 25 merged pull requests and 119 commits from 10 authors, and 53 closed issues.

## rubygems.org news

RubyGems.org has 24 merged pull requests and 59 commits from 13 authors. RubyGems.org got [a variety of infrastructure changes](http://blog.rubygems.org/2016/05/19/simplifying-our-stack.html) this month, including serving our millions of gem requests directly from Fastly and reducing / eliminating reliance on Nginx / Redis.

## rubygems news

RubyGems has 13 merged pull requests and 15 commits from 8 authors this month. Relevant to the state of the commit numbers this month, The RubyGems team [is making a push towards creating a better RubyGems](http://blog.rubygems.org/2016/05/20/rubygems-org-2016-push.html) by increasing contributors, updating policies, and decreasing response times on support issues. Many of the issues described there are due to RubyGems support being run by volunteers, which RubyTogether is working on addressing with the financial support of Ruby community members such as yourselves!
