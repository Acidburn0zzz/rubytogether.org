Thanks to all of our members for making everything that we do possible. &lt;3

We had a quieter month in June, but both [Ruby Me](https://rubyme.org) apprentices and [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) students continued to work on Ruby open source projects.

## bundler news

In June, Bundler saw ongoing fixes, including better support for Ruby 2.6 and integration with ruby-core. In addition, the `bundle clean` command was fixed for git gems in a symlinked location, and the gem management task `rake release` also added support for 2FA when pushing gems to RubyGems.org.

RubyGems.org had the usual ongoing security and dependency updates. It also saw improvements to the Fastly and Nginx configuration that will help us make it faster for newly uploaded gems to be able to be installed. Email notifications got visual design, password resets gained support for 2FA, API keys are now reset at the same time as passwords, and administrators now have more automation to deal with malicious gems or users more easily.

RubyGems saw the usual ongoing fixes, including a fix for the `rubygems-update` gem that allows updating older versions of RubyGems to newer ones. David Rodriguez also did a huge amount of work on the RubyGems test suite, fixing many, many tests that either didn't clean up after themselves or didn't always pass.
