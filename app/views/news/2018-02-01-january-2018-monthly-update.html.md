Hello, and happy New Year! Welcome to the monthly update. During January, our work was supported by [Stripe](https://stripe.com), [Cloud City Development](http://www.cloudcity.io), [Airbnb](http://airbnb.com), [reinteractive](https://reinteractive.com/), and many others.

We're excited to have kicked off the new year with an announcement: the relaunch of the Ruby Toolbox! Read on for more details.

## ruby toolbox

Hello everyone,

Great news: the [Ruby Toolbox is back](https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/blog/2018-02-01/lets-push-things-forward) :)

It took a bit longer than anticipated in the last monthly update (of course it did...), but I hope it was for the best. As I was chugging along on getting the site ready for launch, these tiny things that I wanted to be part of the initial relaunch kept coming up, and ultimately the site relaunched with quite a few things I had lined up for post-launch in the last update—the most notable of them being search—which is now already available.

Still, this is only a starting point. You can find the work lined up for the next few weeks on the [GitHub project](https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox/projects/1), and as feedback from users starts pouring in, I'm sure there will be more.

On top of that, one of the main aspects I want to focus on in the next month is cleaning up the catalog; some categorizations are plain wrong, and some categories may be obsolete by now. I recently also did some [research into using GitHub's new GraphQL API](https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox/pull/94), and want to convert to it as it will unlock plenty of additional metrics that could be added to the site without hitting API rate limiting issues.

See you next month! 
Best,
Christoph
