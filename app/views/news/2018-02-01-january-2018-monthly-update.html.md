Hello, and happy New Year! Welcome to the monthly update. During January, our work was supported by [Stripe](https://stripe.com), [Cloud City Development](http://www.cloudcity.io), [Airbnb](http://airbnb.com), and many others.

We're excited to have kicked off the new year with an announcement: the relaunch of the Ruby Toolbox! Read on for more details.

## ruby together news

In January, Ruby Together was supported by 75 different companies, including Sapphire member [Stripe](https://stripe.com), and 4 companies joined as new members.

On top of those companies, 4 new developers signed up as members or friends of Ruby Together, including Viacheslav Kysil, James Flowers, Stan Lo, and [Georg Gadinger (@nilsding)](https://twitter.com/nilsding). In total, we were supported by 95 individual members and 67 friends of Ruby Together. Thanks to all of our members for making everything that we do possible!

We continued to fill in the remaining seats on the board of directors. During January, we were joined by [Courteney Ervin](https://twitter.com/courteneyervin), and [Adarsh Pandit](https://twitter.com/adarshp). Courteney works for the New York Public Library system, building open-source tools to make ebooks more accessible. Adarsh founded and runs his own software consultancy, [Cylinder Digital](http://cylinder.digital). We're super excited to have their perspectives and input as we work to support the Ruby community.

This month also saw a new dev hire, with long-time contributor [@kerrizor](https://twitter.com/kerrizor) graciously agreeing to help with RubyGems.org support and generally making things better for RubyGems users.

## google summer of code news

In some new and exciting news, we applied to Google Summer of Code! It didn't happen in 2017, but in 2016 we were able to run a Google Summer of Code project for any Ruby codebase. With around a dozen students working on MRI, Bundler, RubyGems, and other projects, it was very exciting. Hopefully we'll have a summer of students working on Ruby OSS in 2018 as well.

## bundler news

Bundler saw a over a dozen bugfixes in January, thanks to contributors including [@KrauseFx](https://www.github.com/KrauseFx), [@akhramov](https://github.com/akhramov), [@christhekeele](https://github.com/christhekeele), [@joelvh](https://github.com/joelvh), and [@ajwann](https://github.com/ajwann). We expect to release those fixes shortly in version 1.16.2. Altogether, Bundler gained 69 new commits, contributed by 18 authors. There were 536 additions and 146 deletions across 57 files.

## rubygems.org news

January was a quiet month for RubyGems.org, with just 1 new commit, contributed by 1 author. There was 1 addition and 1 deletion across 1 file. As always, we also continued to apply security patches and keep the servers behind RubyGems.org operating.

## rubygems news

RubyGems saw a decent amount of activity this month, including bugfixes, error message improvements, and test updates. This month, RubyGems gained 56 new commits, contributed by 11 authors. There were 502 additions and 527 deletions across 63 files.

## gemstash news

In an extremely quiet month, there were no new changes to Gemstash in January. That said, there are definitely [open issues](https://github.com/bundler/gemstash/issues) that would make excellent options for anyone interested in starting to contribute to Ruby open source.

## ruby toolbox

Hello everyone,

Great news: the [Ruby Toolbox is back](https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/blog/2018-02-01/lets-push-things-forward) :)

It took a bit longer than anticipated in the last monthly update (of course it did...), but I hope it was for the best. As I was chugging along on getting the site ready for launch, these tiny things that I wanted to be part of the initial relaunch kept coming up, and ultimately the site relaunched with quite a few things I had lined up for post-launch in the last update—the most notable of them being search—which is now already available.

Still, this is only a starting point. You can find the work lined up for the next few weeks on the [GitHub project](https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox/projects/1), and as feedback from users starts pouring in, I'm sure there will be more.

On top of that, one of the main aspects I want to focus on in the next month is cleaning up the catalog; some categorizations are plain wrong, and some categories may be obsolete by now. I recently also did some [research into using GitHub's new GraphQL API](https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox/pull/94), and want to convert to it as it will unlock plenty of additional metrics that could be added to the site without hitting API rate limiting issues.

See you next month! 
Best,
Christoph
