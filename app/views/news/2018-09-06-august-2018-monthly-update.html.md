Hello! Welcome to the monthly update. During August, our work was supported by [Handshake](https://handshake.org), [reinteractive](https://reinteractive.com/), and many others.

## ruby together news

In August, Ruby Together was supported by 74 different companies. [Handshake](https://www.handshake.org) joined as a [LEVEL] member. In total, we were supported by 77 individual members and 64 friends of Ruby Together. Thanks to all of our members for making everything that we do possible.

In community events, our developer evangelist PJ Hagerty spent some time at the Google Developer Group meetup in New York City, Scenic City Summit in Chattanooga, TN, and AmsterdamRB. Executive director André Arko went to RailsCamp to spread the word about Ruby Together. 

In other community news, our Google Summer of Code students wrapped up their work on our various projects. Special thanks to our GSoC developers for all of their hard work these past few months!

## bundler news

And with the help of [@eanlain](github.com/eanlain), we shipped a new guide: [“How to use Bundler with Docker”](https://bundler.io/v1.16/guides/bundler_docker_guide.html).

We also added a new contributor to the core team: [Stephanie Morillo](https://www.twitter.com/radiomorillo). Stephanie has helped create new Bundler docs (like the troubleshooting RubyGems and Bundler TLS/SSL issues guide), and update existing ones. She’s also responsible for updating the Bundler contributor guidelines and trying to make Bundler docs more accessible to new contributors.

This month, Bundler gained 58 new commits, contributed by 9 authors. There were 334 additions and 54 deletions across 30 files.

## rubygems.org news

In August, we blacklisted gem namespaces which had derivative spellings of Rails dependencies in response to CVE-2018-3779. We also made performance improvements to the “rubygems#show” and “version#index” pages.

This month, RubyGems.org gained 7 commits from 2 authors, making 45 additions and 36 deletions across 9 files.

## rubygems news

This month, RubyGems gained 42 new commits, contributed by 10 authors. There were 429 additions and 186 deletions across 41 files.

## ruby toolbox news
Hey everyone,

Despite my ambitious announcements in the last update, August turned out to be a quiet month for me. I was mostly on vacation visiting family, and while I had hoped to use the available time to also build a bunch of nice stuff for the Toolbox, the need to find some rest and to have a bunch of time with family and away from computers won in the end.

However, I'll finally have the time to ship the public data dumps and search improvements in September I spoke about in recent updates!

In other news, towards the end of August I was in Vienna for the 2018 edition of Euruko, the European Ruby Conference. I'd like to say a big thank you to everyone involved, I think it was a great weekend and a powerful display of the health of our community. Can't wait for next year!

As always, your feedback is very welcome, if you have any suggestions or thoughts you'd like to share you can do so via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox/issues) or by getting in touch with me directly.

Thank you also to the contributor of our sole pull request in August: jrochkind (it seems there were more folks on vacation).

Best,
Christoph
