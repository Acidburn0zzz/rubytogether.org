<% title "August 2016 Monthly Update" %>

Welcome to the Ruby Together update for August 2016. This month, we paid for 65.5 hours of work, had 2 new members join. We released Bundler 1.13 RC2, and created roadmaps for Bundler 1.13, 1.14, 2.0, and RubyGems + Bundler 3.0.

## ruby together news

This August at Ruby Together was marked by personnel shifts. The Google Summer of Code students finished their term, with 12 students successfully completing their projects. The Rails Girls Summer of Code students shifted up their work, submitting their first PR. Our ops engineer's wife had a child (congrats, David + family!) and our project manager had a major surgery.

We had two new developer members join, but no companies. If your company needs Bundler and RubyGems to function, talk to your team about Ruby Together! We need support from companies to keep everything working smoothly.

Voting for the board of directors wrapped up this month. After an incredibly close election, board members [Ines Sombra](http://twitter.com/randommood) and [Coraline Ada Ehmke](http://twitter.com/coralineada) were re-elected to a three year term. Thanks to every member who participated! <3

Ruby Together employees also worked on a variety of smaller tools in the Ruby development ecosystem, including [how-is](https://github.com/how-is/how_is), [vcr](https://github.com/vcr/vcr), and [lita](https://github.com/indirect/lita-tweet).

## bundler news

We ironed out more bugs with Bundler 1.13, and arrived at [1.13.rc2](https://github.com/bundler/bundler/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1130rc2-2016-08-21). Andre created checklists for upcoming versions of Bundler, including [1.13](https://github.com/bundler/bundler/issues/4852), [1.14](https://github.com/bundler/bundler/issues/4853), and [2.0](https://github.com/bundler/bundler/issues/4856). [Bundler.io](https://bundler.io) got its last set of changes courtesy of Google Summer of Code, and will be returning to its mountain lair where it lies in wait for more motivated contributors.

In total, Bundler had 53 merged pull requests and 184 commits from 18 authors, and closed 44 issues.

## rubygems.org news

Rubygems.org got its regular maintenance work, and updates to address security vulnerabilities in the `gem yank` command. With those changes, Rubygems.org had 18 merged pull requests and 26 commits from 7 authors.

## rubygems news

RubyGems got a lot of planning work done towards the 3.0 merge, and now has [an issue](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/issues/1681) to track merger considerations. Including that work, RubyGems had 10 merged pull requests and 10 commits from 5 authors.
