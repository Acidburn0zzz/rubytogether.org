This update doesn't fit exactly into our regular monthly news cycle, but we are excited to announce [project proposals](/projects).

Ruby Together is now accepting proposals from Ruby OSS projects for three months of funded work at the rate of $10,000 USD per month.

Developers submitting proposals can live anywhere in the world, and work on any Ruby open source project. The project selection committee will choose which projects to fund based on our existing budget, and Ruby Together will fund development work on those projects for three months.

Applications are open now. [Apply today](/projects)!
