Hello! Welcome to the monthly update. During April, we paid for 133.5 hours of developer work, supported by [Stripe](https://stripe.com), [Coinbase](https://coinbase.com), [reinteractive](https://reinteractive.com/), [Airbnb](http://airbnb.com), and many others.


## ruby together news

It's our birthday! üéâüéÇ As of this update, Ruby Together is officially 3 years old. We made it! Thanks for all of your help and support along the way.

In April, Ruby Together was supported by 80 different companies, including Sapphire member [Stripe](https://stripe.com). 6 companies joined as new members, including [Piece of Code](http://www.pieceofcode.com) and [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com).

On top of those companies, 6 new developers signed up as members or friends of Ruby Together, including Tom Johnson, Pat Allan, Jameson Hampton, and Jeremy Flores. In total, we were supported by 92 individual members and 71 friends of Ruby Together. Thanks to all of our members for making everything that we do possible. &lt;3

### new devs

[Luis Sagastume](https://github.com/bronzdoc), a longtime contributor to RubyGems, agreed to start helping us maintain RubyGems and Gemstash. He will continue working with the existing RubyGems and Gemstash teams, fixing bugs and adding features. Welcome to Ruby Together, Luis!

[Aditya Prakash](https://github.com/sonalkr132), a longtime contributor to RubyGems.org, has joined us to work on RubyGems.org. We're excited to have him on board, and looking forward to his help keeping the servers running efficiently and securely.

### google summer of code

As we mentioned last month, Google accepted our application to bring back the Ruby umbrella organization for Summer of Code projects improving not just implementations of Ruby, but any Ruby open source project. Our efforts were more successful than we expected, and more than 50 students submitted project applications! We were able to accept six of those students. We are very excited to be hosting Shlok Srivastava, Qio Chaofan, Nicholas Yang, Yimin Zhao, Agrim Mittal, and Yogesh Kataria this summer, as they work on RubyGems, MRI, Bundler, and RDoc. Check back for progress updates next month!

### railsconf

Board members Andr√©, Coraline, Adarsh, and Valerie attended RailsConf 2018. Coraline gave a talk on "Scaling the Software Artisan" and Andr√© gave a talk titled "Pairing: a guide to fruitful collaboration üçìüçëüçê". Adarsh and Valerie arranged a scheduled session for in-person community feedback, and brought that feedback back to the board.

At RailsConf we also distributed stickers and copies of our latest project, a collaboration with bubblesort.io titled ["The Evolution of Bundler"](https://twitter.com/sailorhg/status/984232596870606848?s=12). Coming soon, members will be able to download a PDF of the zine for free, and anyone will be able to purchase a copy of the zine from the Ruby Together store. Stay tuned!

### community feedback

In post-RailsConf news, the board met with Ruby developer Sam Phippen to discuss his concerns about Ruby Together's governance model. As a result of that conversation, we held a board meeting and created a new forum for communication between the community and the board. [We published the results of the meeting](https://rubytogether.org/news/2018-04-25-april-22-board-meeting-results), and we expect to continue addressing community concerns in future work.

If you have feedback for the board, or concerns that you'd like to share open an issue in the Ruby Together [Board GitHub repo](https://github.com/rubytogether/board) or send us an email at [feedback@rubytogether.org](mailto:feedback@rubytogether.org). (And feel free take a look at our [frequently asked questions](https://rubytogether.org/companies#faq) to learn more about how we work.)

## bundler news

This month, we fixed various bugs, worked towards releasing 1.16.2 with more bug fixes, and improved the way we hide Git URL usernames and passwords for the future. Bundler gained 28 new commits, contributed by 15 authors. There were 204 additions and 35 deletions across 22 files.

## rubygems.org news

This month, RubyGems.org saw some minor site fixes, as well as ongoing server maintenance and security patches. The app gained 11 new commits, contributed by 4 authors. There were 62 additions and 54 deletions across 26 files.

## rubygems news

RubyGems saw improved error messages, fixes for several issues related to file permissions, encoding, and other minor issues. We also continued to implement the previously planned work for the long-term transision to RubyGems 3 before the end of the year. This month, RubyGems gained 17 new commits, contributed by 7 authors. There were 148 additions and 163 deletions across 28 files.

## gemstash news

We made a few minor updates to Gemstash in April, and picked back up work to add support for storing private gems in AWS S3, as well as starting work to provide the new compact index used by Bundler for faster gem installation. Gemstash gained 8 new commits, contributed by 3 authors. There were 12 additions and 9 deletions across 3 files.

## ruby toolbox news

Hey everyone!

Due to a whole bunch of other obligations, April turned out to be a rather slow month; apart from some very minor maintenance work, I sadly did not find any time to spend meaningful work on the Ruby Toolbox. That being said, May looks a bit more promising. Rolling over my plans from the last monthly update for March, I want to focus mostly on making it easier to see at a glance how a projects given metric relates to the greater ecosystem - so for example in what percentile the number of downloads is in relation to other projects.

As always, your feedback is very welcome, if you have any suggestions or thoughts you'd like to share you can do so via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox/issues) or by getting in touch with me directly.

Thank you also to everyone who contributed pull requests in April: bethink, danielwestendorf, khiav223577, nesaulov, skatkov, siong1987, swrobel, and vyncem.

Best,
Christoph
