Hello! Welcome to the monthly update. During April, we paid for 133.5 hours of developer work, supported by [Stripe](https://stripe.com), [Coinbase](https://coinbase.com), [reinteractive](https://reinteractive.com/), [Airbnb](http://airbnb.com), and many others.


## ruby together news

In April, Ruby Together was supported by 80 different companies, including Sapphire member [Stripe](https://stripe.com). 6 companies joined as new members, including [Piece of Code](http://www.pieceofcode.com) and [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com).

On top of those companies, 6 new developers signed up as members or friends of Ruby Together, including Tom Johnson, Pat Allan, Jameson Hampton, and Jeremy Flores. In total, we were supported by 92 individual members and 71 friends of Ruby Together. Thanks to all of our members for making everything that we do possible. &lt;3

The board met with Ruby developer Sam Phippen to discuss his concerns about Ruby Together’s governance model. As a result of our conversation, we held a board meeting and created a new forum for communication between the community and the board. [We shared the results of the meeting](https://rubytogether.org/news/2018-04-25-april-22-board-meeting-results), and we expect to continue addressing community concerns in future work. If you have feedback for the board, or concerns that you’d like to share [open an issue in the Ruby Together [Board GitHub repo](https://github.com/rubytogether/board) or send us an email at [feedback@rubytogether.org](mailto:feedback@rubytogether.org). (And feel free take a look at our [frequently asked questions](https://rubytogether.org/companies#faq) to learn more about how we work.)

[Luis Sagastume](https://github.com/bronzdoc), a longtime contributor to RubyGems, agreed to start helping us maintain RubyGems and Gemstash. He will continue working with the existing RubyGems and Gemstash teams, fixing bugs and adding features. Welcome to Ruby Together, Luis!

Board members André, Coraline, Adarsh, and Valerie attended RailsConf 2018. Coraline gave a talk on “Scaling the Software Artisan” and André gave a talk titled “Pairing: a guide to fruitful collaboration :strawberry::peach::pear:“. Adarsh and Valerie arranged a scheduled session for in-person community feedback, and brought that feedback back to the board.

At RailsConf we also distributed stickers and copies of our latest project, a collaboration with bubblesort.io titled [“The Evolution of Bundler”](https://twitter.com/sailorhg/status/984232596870606848?s=12). Coming soon, members will be able to download a PDF of the zine for free, and anyone will be able to purchase a copy of the zine from the Ruby Together store. Stay tuned!

## gemstash news

We made a few minor updates to Gemstash in April. Gemstash gained 8 new commits, contributed by 3 authors. There were 12 additions and 9 deletions across 3 files.

## ruby toolbox news

Hey everyone!

Due to a whole bunch of other obligations, April turned out to be a rather slow month; apart from some very minor maintenance work, I sadly did not find any time to spend meaningful work on the Ruby Toolbox. That being said, May looks a bit more promising. Rolling over my plans from the last monthly update for March, I want to focus mostly on making it easier to see at a glance how a projects given metric relates to the greater ecosystem - so for example in what percentile the number of downloads is in relation to other projects.

As always, your feedback is very welcome, if you have any suggestions or thoughts you'd like to share you can do so via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox/issues) or by getting in touch with me directly.

Thank you also to everyone who contributed pull requests in April: bethink, danielwestendorf, khiav223577, nesaulov, skatkov, siong1987, swrobel, and vyncem.

Best,
Christoph
