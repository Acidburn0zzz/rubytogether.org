<% title "October 2016 Monthly Update" %>

Welcome to the October 2016 Ruby Together monthly update! This month we released Bundler `1.13.[3..6]`, weathered great internet storms, and dramatically improved response times. We did it with 70.3 hours of paid work on Bundler, RubyGems, and RubyGems.org.

## ruby together news

This month, Michael R. Bernstein (@mrb_bk) has joined us as a consultant to help with marketing, sales, and automation. (You can see more about what he does with his company Computer Modern at [computermodern.io](http://computermodern.io)!)

There were 6 new developer members this month! Many thanks to Megan Tiu, John Akers, Rob Nichols, Olivier Lacan, Cameron Dutro, and Christoph Lupprich ^_^ !!!

We also saw signups from two new corporate members this month: [Gleam](https://gleam.io/), a business growth and marketing platform, and [Brakeman Pro](https://brakemanpro.com/), a Rails security auditing system.

## bundler news

We released Bundler [1.13.3](https://github.com/bundler/bundler/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1133-2016-10-10), [1.13.4](https://github.com/bundler/bundler/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1134-2016-10-11), [1.13.5](https://github.com/bundler/bundler/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1135-2016-10-15), [1.13.6](https://github.com/bundler/bundler/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1136-2016-10-22). `1.13.3` was support for rubygems.org infrastructure changes, `1.13.[4..6]` was your regularly scheduled fixes and optimizations.

We noticed from our traffic stats that a few thousand [Bash on Windows](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about) users were experiencing [bundler/bundler#4599](https://github.com/bundler/bundler/issues/4599). [The cause](https://github.com/Microsoft/BashOnWindows/issues/352) of this issue is home directory permissions, but we pushed out a fix for the sake of the number of effected users. [This fix](https://github.com/bundler/bundler/pull/5043) was deployed in `1.13.4`.

In total, Bundler had 35 merged pull requests and 106 commits from 12 authors, and closed 59 issues.

## rubygems.org news

We finished moving Bundler server infrastructure into rubygems.org, culminating in resolving an issue with `/versions` mismatches. With this, we are now serving all of rubygems.org from [Fastly](https://www.fastly.com/). This change [cut down server response times by half](https://twitter.com/dwradcliffe/status/786280193107202048)!

Later in the month, we survived the survived the [Great DNS Outage of 2016](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/blame-the-internet-of-things-for-destroying-the-internet-today). [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org/) was up the entire time, although most of our other tools weren't.

In total, RubyGems.org had 18 merged pull requests and 33 commits from 8 authors.

## rubygems news

We released RubyGems [2.6.8](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/commit/9fb8880976f5ab998912898b091d88aa10eb1d4a) this month. This release comes with [improved SSL error messaging](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/1751), which will hopefully relieve some frustration during this time of great turmoil.

In total, RubyGems had 18 merged pull requests and 29 commits from 10 authors.

## budget & expenses

From September 19 to October 18, Ruby Together took in $22851.42. In total, we spent $20368.58. Here's a breakdown of where the money went:

Until next time,<br>
