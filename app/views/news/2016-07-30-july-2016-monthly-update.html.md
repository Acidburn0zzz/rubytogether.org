# july 2016 monthly update

Welcome to the Ruby Together update for July 2016. This month, we paid for 64.4 hours of work, had 5 new members join, and had another solid month from our summer coding students. Work done this month includes a designed <Bundler.io>, and prerequisites for Bundler 2.0 and Bundler / RubyGems 3.0.

## ruby together news

The focus at RubyTogether this month was our contractors and summer coding students, and work towards big future version releases. The biggest event was [@kruczjak](https://github.com/kruczjak) and [@sailorhg](https://twitter.com/sailorhg)'s work on the <Bundler.io> redesign, which dramatically updated the style and added an array of functionality. The highlights of that work are detailed in [@kruczjak's post](http://bundler.io/blog/2016/07/10/bundler-1-13-and-redesigned-bundler-io.html). Then there was the [Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/) students working on a variety of small Bundler features, and the [Rails Girls Summer of Code](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/) students gearing up to working on Bundler's analytics system. Finally we had [@segiddins](https://github.com/segiddins) working on future Bundler / RubyGems updates, [@duckinator](https://github.com/duckinator/) on [how-is](https://github.com/how-is), and [@lynnco](https://github.com/LynnCo) on administrative automation.

We had two 5 new members join this month, including 3 new developers and 2 new companies. We appreciate everyone getting the word out, and encouraging people to support the Ruby community!

## bundler news

This was a very busy month for Bundler, with 15 authors getting 35 merged PRs with 251 commits. Features include: [RubyGems / Bundler Integration](https://github.com/bundler/bundler/pull/4770), [respecting the required Ruby version](https://github.com/bundler/bundler/pull/4650), [a warning message / upgrade guide](https://github.com/bundler/bundler/pull/4741) for Bundler 2.0, [trampolining fixes](https://github.com/bundler/bundler/issues/4753) which will allow Bundler 2.0 to run 1.X versions, and [bundler-patch](https://github.com/bundler/bundler/pull/4676). Most of that work will be shipping with Bundler release 1.13.

## rubygems.org news

RubyGems.org this month was mostly [content updates](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/pull/1359) and [minor security changes](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/pull/1342). Notably, though, we got a first time open source contributor! [They added](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/pull/1361) a Twitter field to RubyGems.org user profiles. In total we had 9 authors working on 27 merges with 67 commits.

## rubygems news

RubyGems this month was mostly [minor](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/1666) [fixes](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/1659), across 1 author (our own [Samuel Giddins](https://github.com/segiddins)), 3 merges, and 10 commits. Near the end of this month, the [first](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/1639) of what will likely be many Bundler / RubyGems PRs was resolved, moving us closer to Bundler / RubyGems 3.0.
