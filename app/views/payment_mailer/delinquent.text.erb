Hi <%= @name %>,

Thanks for being a member of Ruby Together! We really appreciate your support.

We just wanted to let you know that your Ruby Together payments failed a few
times, so Stripe automatically deactivated your subscription at some point.

If you're happy for us to reactivate your subscription then please just reply
to this email, to give us permission to do so, and we'll sort it out for you.

You can easily check whether your payment information is correct using this link:
<%= membership_url(token: @token) %>

We'd be delighted to have your support again!  It makes a big difference.

Thanks,
Ruby Together
