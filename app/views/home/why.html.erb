<% title "Why Join Ruby Together?" %>

<p>As a company that builds software with Ruby, your business and its profits rely on the <%= link_to "public infrastructure", projects_path %> of the Ruby language, including <%= rubygems %>, <%= bundler %>, and the <%= rubygems_org %> servers. That infrastructure is critical to the operation of your business, and  before Ruby Together, it was maintained entirely by volunteers!</p>

<p>Ruby Together pays our <%= link_to "systems administrators and developers", team_path %> fairly for their work on Ruby infrastructure, ensuring that issues can be resolved as needed rather than <%= link_to "waiting for a volunteer to be awake and have spare time", "http://blog.rubygems.org/2014/08/07/postmortem.html" %>. RubyGems.org downtime keeps your developers from being able to work on your business, a cost much higher than membership dues.</p>

<p>In addition to supporting infrastructure you depend on, membership in Ruby Together means that your engineers will have access to <%= link_to "some of the most knowledgable Ruby developers", team_path %> in the world. Chances are good your developers would love to chat with the developer of <%= bundler %> about managing dependencies and other problems that you've encountered. Members can do that.</p>

<p>We already have a <%= link_to "long roadmap", plans_path %> of improvements that will make Ruby better for everyone, including your team. Faster bundling, stable servers, and new features and projects to support increased development speed and security. <%= link_to "Our team", team_path %> has an solid track record of delivering improvements to Ruby's <%= link_to "public infrastructure", projects_path %> for years now, and Ruby Together will allow that to continue for years to come.</p>

<p>Corporate membership in Ruby Together provides your development team with the direct benefits of networking opportunities and the indirect benefits of stable, well-maintained Ruby infrastructure. As Ruby Together grows, the <%= link_to "benefits of membership", benefits_path %> will grow as well. Start experiencing those benefits right away when you <%= link_to "join Ruby Together", new_membership_path %>!</p>
