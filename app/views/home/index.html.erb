<p>Stop hoping that developers will maintain and improve Ruby's public infrastructure for free in their spare time, and start relying on tools that work.</p>

<section class="group">
  <h4>Ruby Together is a better way to maintain and improve the Ruby tools that everyone relies on.</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>Community funding allows Ruby Together to pay developers to work on improving Bundler, RubyGems.org, and other shared tools.</li>
    <li>The Ruby Together board of directors (elected by members) selects the most impactful projects to work on.</li>
    <li>Ruby Together publishes monthly updates showing progress and results.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>“Better tooling means ease of use for our engineers and customers. Our engineering and support teams benefit by having things working better at a fast pace, meaning we can provide more to our customer base.”</p>
