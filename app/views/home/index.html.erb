  <ul>
    <li>Community funding allows Ruby Together to pay developers to work on improving Bundler, RubyGems.org, and other shared tools.</li>
    <li>The Ruby Together board of directors (elected by members) selects the most impactful projects to work on.</li>
    <li>Ruby Together publishes monthly updates showing progress and results.</li>
